This archive contains the distribution CGI-Pager,
version 1.01:

  CGI::Pager performs the dirty work necessary to program paginated data display in a web application. Based on given resultset size, page size, and offset value sensed from current URI, it constructs links for navigation between results pages. It can be used conveniently from a templating system, has both OO and functional interface, and can optionally generate necessary HTML itself.
